Time Taken: 7 hours <br />
Time Distribution <br />
Project Setup & Architecture: 1 hr <br />
App UI, Outlets and Actions Handling: 1 hr <br />

<br />
I've not added more layers to architecture as per the requirements of the project <br />
Things that could've been added more scalable project <br />
RxSwift for better binding of properties & views<br />
Coordinators for routing handling throughout app<br />
Programmatic UI instead of storyboards for better reusability of components and also makes solving UI conflicts easily<br />
